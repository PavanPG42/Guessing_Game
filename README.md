# 🎯 Guess the Number - Rust CLI Game

This is a simple command-line number guessing game written in Rust. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user must guess it. 
The game provides hints if the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- The program randomly generates a **secret number** between `1` and `100`.
- The player enters guesses.
- The program checks and provides feedback:
  - "Too small!" if the guess is low
  - "Too big!" if the guess is high
  - "You win!" when guessed correctly

## 🧠 Features

- Random number generation
- Looping until correct guess
